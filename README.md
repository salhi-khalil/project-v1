this is about doctors and Patients ...

The idea is that the visitor before being a Patient can see the doctors list..

if he want to take and  get an appointment he have to sign in.

the doctor in the other side must fill an other type of sign in to get well known...

the subscribe is easy and all content will be accessible..

we used here the MERN stack... :  MongoDB Express React and NodeJs...

I tried to use pure CSS during the project...

the use of some middlewares ...

we hashed password using bcrypt ... and we use JWT for generetaing the token .



 this is the admin account 
 
khalil@doctors.com

else you can sign up as a doctor or as a patient
